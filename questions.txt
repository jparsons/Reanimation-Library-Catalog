What size to make the images? Square image thumbnails or maintain aspect ratio?

Can acquisition type and work type be constants, or do they need to be added to? Maybe an autocomplete would work better?

Which one is the library id?

Should provenance go on the acquisition form or with the metadata?


Subjects - should this really be auto complete? If so, how to handle subject authority?
